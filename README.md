# X-dapp

This is the X(formerly twitter) dapp version.

## About

Why are we building it? Recently, there has been a constant debate regarding data privacy, ownership and advertising revenues of social media platforms. It is indeed true that the top ten tech companies in the world control most of the digital data globally. This means that we don‚Äôt have rights and control to our privacy, data and the decisions we make in our daily lives.

It is now much more important than ever that we use decentralized internet (web3) as a tool to create a space where users can actually own and control their data rather than being sold by giants for advertising revenue. It is for this very reason I felt like while you are learning about Solidity and the web3 ecosystem, why don‚Äôt I attempt to create a decentralized version of Twitter (a Twitter DApp üê¶).

## What are we enabling??

- The app will have the following functionality;
- Sign-in via Twitter using Web3Auth
- Write a tweet as NFT
- Upvote and Comment on a tweet
- Buy a tweet on OpenSea.
- Interoperability of the DApp with Torus Wallet and Wallet Connect

### What is included ??

- Social Login functionality by Web3Auth
- Using Quicknode RPC . As the name implies, they are quick and easy to set up, and support newer Testnets like Goerli and Mumbai.
- Writing smart contracts in solidity
- Minting NFTs using ERC 721
- Integrating with the OpenSea platform
- Using OpenZeppelin libraries to make our life easier
- Utilizing the power of React to build our very own frontend similar to Twitter‚Äôs homepage
- Integrating with Torus Wallet
- Building End To End Applications
- Using Remix IDE for contract tests.
